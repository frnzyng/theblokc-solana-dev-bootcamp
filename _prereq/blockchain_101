BLOCKCHAIN

A blockchain is a kind of database architecture that stores data in a so-called "block" then that block is shared among all the computers in the 
network for validation. Once validated, the block will be added to the blockchain. Each block contains a "hash code" of all the data that is stored 
in the block and also the hash of its previous block. Hence, a blockchain is more secured because it would be difficult to edit or manipulate 
data inside the block since each block has the hash of their previous block. If the data inside a block is edited, the hash automatically changes, 
this would easily be noticed by its subsequent block.
